                <span class="card-title black-text">When in Rome, Addiction Means Something Else</span>
                <p>Addiction: from the Roman times, to surrender oneself to a master</p>
                <p>Over time, this evolved into meaning a dedication for doing something, and was used in a way much like how today we would say we are "addicted to sushi" or "addicted to our smartphones". This was how people perceived addiction in the beginning of the Victorian era.</p>
                <p>As the Victorian era progressed, addiction began to include addiction to alcohol, and drugs such as opium, cocaine, and morphine.</p>

                <p>Recreational drug use was not taken as seriously as it is today. Early Victorian era writers, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Shelley, often took opiates for recreational purposes. Many of their most famous works were written under the influence of a drug, when their mental state was so altered that all existing habits were broken, giving way to new inspirations.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>The Victorian era was known for its plethora of scientific discoveries and its shift to empirical medical practices. Prior to this change, however, physicians would often prescribe alcohol and later morphine and other opiates as medicine. While they were able to cure the pain, they also induced a sensation of pleasure that had the patient longing for more. Many patients who were initially treated with morphine became addicted to the drug. Thankfully, as the Victorian era progressed, these "medicine" that seem ridiculous to us today began to be phased out and replaced with new approaches backed by scientific studies.</p>

                    <p>Temperance viewpoint on alcoholism was that it was to be consumed in moderation. Too much, and it would destroy one's life. Yet, instead of outright banning alcohol, temperists helped working class stay away from alcohol by encouraging them to spend their money on other, more worthwhile items, such as clothes and food. Seems reasonable, right?</p>

                <p>Over time, however, the public grew less and less accepting of drug use. Instead of the mind opener it was once thought of by the romantics, drugs and alcohol became associated with the working class and their rowdy entertainment. Thus began the stigma against drug addicts that persists to this day.</p>
